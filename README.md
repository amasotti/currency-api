# Demo Currency App 

__dummy project to demo / experiment with git cliff__

__date:__ May 2024

## Description

The project is a (very rudimentary) currency converter app that uses the Frankfurter API 
to get the exchange rates. The app is built using Ktor, a Kotlin framework for building lightweight
web applications.

The API itself is just a kind of "Hello-World" project; what I really wanted to test here is
the `git-cliff` tool, which is a tool to generate changelogs from git history.

The real protagonist here is thus the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) file, which is generated by `git-cliff`.
