# Demo Currency App 

__dummy project to demo use of git cliff__

__date:__ May 2024

## Description

The project is a (very rudimental) currency converter app that uses the Frankfurter API 
to get the latest exchange rates. The app is built using Ktor, a Kotlin framework for building lightweight
web applications.

The API itself is just kind of "Hello-World" project, what I wanted to test here is
the `git-cliff` tool, which is a tool to generate changelogs from git history.
